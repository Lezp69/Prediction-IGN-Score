# IGN MOVIE SCORE PREDICTION

This repository contains contains a project that predicts the IGN (Imagine Games Network) score for Movies based on reviews. The project uses web scraping techniques to collect data for then clean and preprocess. The author tries several machine learning models, including SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVR, to predict the IGN score. The models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared value. The author trains and tests each model using an 70/30 split of the data and compares their performances. Finally, the author compares actual vs. predicted scores.

## About the Project

This Project is a data analysis and inference project that explores the reviews and scores from IGN. The main objectives of this project are:

- Collecting IGN data from the main source.
- Analyzing words statistics.
- Visualizing data using graphs, charts, and other visual representations.
- Providing insights and observations based on the analysis.
- Using Featurte Engineering techniques.
- Trying several machine learning models

The project focuses on using Python as the primary programming language and leverages popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, wordcloud, sklearn, and nltk  for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, text transformation, and predictions.
