      "{'Title': 'Divinity Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Divinity, the fifth film by Eddie Alcazar, is a strange and propulsive curio. Part retrofuturistic sci-fi, part meditation on masculine form (and shot entirely in black-and-white), it has the kind of plot you can only half-describe on paper, but its oblique genre musings are presented in alluring and esoteric fashion, making it hard to look away. Inventor and marketer Jaxxon Pierce (Stephen Dorff) creates an immortality serum that changes the world as we know it, but this incurs the wrath of supernaturally powered beings from… somewhere, and somewhen. Earth? A distant galaxy? Centuries in the future? It’s hard to be sure. Divinity isn’t concerned with these details, but rather with the anxieties surrounding mortality in the modern world. These pieces don’t always fit together, and they can be frustrating to interpret, but the result is never boring, thanks to images you’ve likely never seen assembled this way.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Divinity Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': \"Archival footage of a long-dead scientist, Sterling Pierce (Scott Bakula), sets the stage: On the verge of a major breakthrough, Sterling desperately searches for ways to synthesize a chemical that can halt mental and physical aging, though his work is incomplete. Most of the movie unfolds decades later, after Sterling’s sons – the business-minded Jaxxon and the aptly-named bodybuilder Rip (Michael O'Hearn) – have perfected their father’s formula, which they’ve dubbed “Divinity,” and turned it into a global industry. It is, however, intentionally difficult to tell when the story is set, thanks to the design sensibilities Jaxxon’s lavish home, which combines mid-century modern furnishings with screens out of the 1980s and some much more recent technology. It feels like a film out of time, which is precisely the vibe given off by its two groups of otherworldly humanoids, who seldom interact but have their own distinct missions.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Divinity Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'In a white void, a cult of silent, stoic women in matching bodysuits parse Earthly goings on. Led by their matriarch Ziva (Bella Thorne), they discuss rescuing fertile women and inducting them into their ranks, since this apparent future has seen the human race rendered largely sterile. There’s a godlike benevolence to Ziva, her clan, and the gentle light that envelops them – but it’s hard to tell if these are human women at all, rather than some sort of extraterrestrial lifeforms or even psychic manifestations whose words seem to echo endlessly.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Divinity Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Meanwhile, in the sprawling desert where Jaxxon has built his isolated mansion, meteor strikes mark the arrival of two young brothers (Moises Arias and Jason Genao). Clad in black vests, their eyes occasionally gleam in sync and their forearms bear what appear to be lengthy, gloved tattoos wrapped all around their skin. Once the brothers make their way to Jaxxon’s residence, they capture him with the use of Star Trek-esque stun guns and speak almost in riddles about the moral havoc Jaxxon either has caused, or will cause – the details are left vague. (Similarly obscured: The enraging secret source of Divinity, which they discover in his lab.) As a form of revenge, the mysterious siblings hook Jaxxon up to a powerful, constant dose of his own chemicals, resulting in a physically grotesque transformation that brings the most troubling aspects of male self-image and body standards into sharp, unyielding focus.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Divinity Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'But when a hired sex worker, Nikita (Karrueche Tran), comes knocking on Jaxxon’s door ahead of the birthday bash he’s planned for that evening, the film switches gears from these half-formed sci-fi concepts, shifting towards the ravenous pleasures of food, dance, and flesh – involving a mutual seduction between Nikita and the brothers that blossoms into a profound mutual understanding.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Divinity Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': \"While it seems to lack substance at times, calling Divinity's approach “style over substance” would be a misnomer. It’s style as substance, with meaning and intent woven into the fabric of each grainy, high-contrast, 16mm composition: Cinematographer Danny Hiele turns each shadowy frame into a mystery of its own. The camera shakes and quivers, warping the texture of both simple shots of characters engaged in revelry and sweeping drone footage of the surrounding landscape, usually backed by a night sky so clear that it feels like a dream.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Divinity Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Divinity often emits an uncanny glow, complemented by its pulsating musical score by Cypress Hill alumnus DJ Muggs and Twin Peaks sound designer Dean Hurley. And while the film often runs the risk of self-absorption – it’s so intent on obfuscating its meaning that its characters occasionally become mere ciphers – Alcazar’s lo-fi flourishes turn it from a potentially pretentious work of arthouse endurance into a charming 86-minute genre throwback. Its action-heavy climax involves highly detailed prosthetics and stop-motion trickery; the whole endeavor plays like a Twilight Zone episode about rebirth as written by a Rod Serling who’s hopped up on techno and MDMA.

      "{'Title': 'The Killer Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': \"David Fincher’s new movie, The Killer, calls back to the filmmaker’s Fight Club adaptation, letting the audience in on an unnamed lead character’s inner monologue. In frank voiceover, the titular assassin (Michael Fassbender, in his first feature since 2019’s Dark Phoenix), relates thoughts that span from quotes to live by (some with attribution, others' authors forgotten) to job-focused tactics to the mantra that keeps him focused. “Stick to the plan. Trust no one. Anticipate, don't improvise. Fight only the battle you're paid to fight.” He speaks of what he calls “the void of life,” and how his ability to recognize it sets him apart – not one of the many, but the few.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Killer Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'In his seemingly untouchable way, though, he is part of an even more exclusive group: he is the only, and something about that is always ready to be cracked and broken by fate. The Killer is a return to form for Fincher, who has made meals of these kinds of stories in the past, but with this film, he expertly lays bare how untouchability is dismantled by emotion, and how that can force even the most calculated into a quest for a kind of absolution – even a bloody one. '}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Killer Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Fassbender’s character is unflinchingly good at his job, precise in all the ways that would make anyone capable of the emotional compartmentalization necessary to be a first-rate murderer. Despite being a destroyer of worlds, the killer is, at least, truthful in his thoughts, and it allows the audience to root for him as a complicated protagonist. We meet him keeping watch meticulously, doing Patrick Bateman-style yoga in a run-down hideout disguised as a Parisian WeWork. When a run-of-the-mill assignment goes awry, he is forced to adjust his methods, craft a plan to save his skin, and get satisfying revenge in the only way he knows how.  '}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Killer Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Andrew Kevin Walker’s script – based on the French graphic novel series by Alexis “Matz” Nolent – strikes the proper tone, giving the killer both interiority as well as a compelling desire to keep control of his circumstances. Walker’s work even brings a sense of humanity to the character with small tells within the killer’s monologues – tiny moments where we see that his emotional life is as rich as our own.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Killer Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': \"Fassbender is smart and stylish in the role, giving us a quiet but weighty performance that leans into the lone-wolf necessities of this perverse line of work. At times, he seems like someone we could find likable if we met him on the street; in other moments, his ruthless brutality is on full display. Tilda Swinton has a small part in the film, but it's nevertheless a pivotal one, and she perfectly embodies the qualities of wise and seasoned yet resigned. To give anything further away about her character would be a spoiler, but it’s a delight to see her show up in this story, even for just a scene. Another short-but-sweet appearance in The Killer comes from a less likely source: BBC journalist Fiona Bruce, an interesting bit of casting but nevertheless a good one. Her performance is natural and nuanced for the few minutes we get with her.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Killer Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Naturally, the film is full of murders, but when the killing ramps up – and it does, in Florida of all places – the big fight scene is a joy. That might sound morbid, but the scene is impeccably choreographed, cut, and edited, to the point where it’s impossible to check out from. The violence is captivating – which might say a lot about society, but Fincher capitalizes on our proclivities, even the bloody ones, in a similar fashion to the way he did in Fight Club.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Killer Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'By the end of Fincher’s bombastic odyssey, the killer admits something to us. If we too can see the void, then maybe we’re all actually just one of the many – and maybe, just maybe, we’re like him. It’s a poignant closing moment and a reversal of his original philosophy that tells us something crucial about this character: He ultimately always wanted to be one of the many, one of the people who can shed the skin they live in and find some kind of peace within that void. With the ending Fincher and Walker give to the titular killer, full of satisfaction and a prescient calm after the storm, it seems like he may have gotten his wish. As for us? We’re left repeating his mantras, dissecting his work, and, at least in my case, itching to press replay on the whole damn affair.'}\n",
      "{'Title': \"Five Nights at Freddy's Review - IGN\", 'Paragraph': \"How did a point-and-click indie horror game become one of the biggest multimedia sensations of the last decade? No jump scare could be more surprising than the sheer runaway success of Five Nights at Freddy's. At the same time, it's not so hard to see what the fuss is about. The first game especially is a novel and ingenious assault on the nerves. Set in an abandoned Chuck E. Cheese-style pizzeria where the animatronic attractions lurch to life at night, the original FNaF drew its cruel power from how helpless it left the player feeling. You have no weapons, no escape route, nothing but a limited range of defensive actions, all linked to a rapidly depleting power source. It was an exercise in nightmare minimalism – a surveillance simulator of doom. The fanbase was deserved, if still unfathomably massive.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': \"Five Nights at Freddy's Review - IGN\", 'Paragraph': \"That this relentlessly milked cash cow and merchandising gold mine would eventually be turned into a movie was inevitable. So, too, were the challenges facing any filmmaker attempting to bring Freddy and his roving robot friends from monitor to silver screen. A master of suspense, like John Carpenter in his prime, could maybe have preserved the single-setting claustrophobia – that sense of being locked in one place as evil approaches from all sides. What we get instead from director and co-writer Emma Tammi, producer Jason Blum, and the game's original creator, Scott Cawthon, is a Five Nights at Freddy's that's been opened up in multiple respects, none of them agreeable.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': \"Five Nights at Freddy's Review - IGN\", 'Paragraph': 'Out of viable occupational options after mistaking a bad dad for a kidnapper at the mall, security guard Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) reluctantly agrees to work the graveyard shift watching over the long-shuttered \\'80s eatery Freddy Fazbear\\'s Pizza, where the synthetic entertainers prove less… immobile than one might hope. Mike arguably has bigger problems than the fearsome oversized animal mascots stomping around his new workplace. If he doesn\\'t get his act together, he might lose custody of his kid sister (Piper Rubio) to his cartoonishly villainous aunt (Mary Stuart Masterson). We know she\\'s a monster, organic rather than mechanical, because she\\'s rude to service workers: \"Are you being paid by the word?\" she quips at a waiter. Given the volume of superfluous gab, you might ask the screenwriters the same thing.'}\n",
      "{'Title': \"Five Nights at Freddy's Review - IGN\", 'Paragraph': \"As if premature orphanhood weren't enough, Mike is also haunted by the childhood disappearance of his little brother, who was snatched during a day at the park and never seen again. Yes, contemporary horror's obsession with trauma has breached even the colorful walls of Freddy's. Hutcherson's hero will spend much more time grappling with his demons – and talking to ghosts, figurative and literal – than he will be scanning staticky monitors for signs of herky-jerky movement. Who invited the therapist to the pizza party?\"}\n",

The movie's heart monitor does briefly, faintly spike once Mike actually settles into security detail inside the deserted restaurant, a flickering neon graveyard of a play place. Rather than lock us into a nightmarish night shift, though, this Five Nights keeps scanning for an exit. No sooner are we on Freddy's turf than we're back in suburbia, watching Mike fight for custody or entertain a quasi-romance with a local cop (Elizabeth Lail) so full of helpful tidbits of backstory that they could have named her Officer Exposition. Here, the title proves less of a promise of escalating nocturnal danger than an excuse to break up the supposed horror with endless daytime soap.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': \"Five Nights at Freddy's Review - IGN\", 'Paragraph': \"There's somehow too much and not enough of the animatronics. Created by the Jim Henson Creature Shop, they naturally look pretty cool – both faithful to the game design and credible, physical machinery, like something you might have scarring memories of seeing in the '80s or '90s. But the movie doesn't seem entirely sure of how scary it's allowed to make them. Yes, tweens will see this PG-13 horror movie, but they also play the games, and the robots are rather frightening there – in part, it must be said, because you only ever see them locked in staring place, waiting for you to look away before they move again, à la those statue phantoms from Doctor Who. Here, they kind of lumber around like Barney, shedding menace by the heavy footstep. And the movie makes a huge miscalculation in turning them into misunderstood monsters, with an origin story that's technically from the games but deflating in adaptation.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': \"Five Nights at Freddy's Review - IGN\", 'Paragraph': \"There was a mockbuster version of this premise a few years ago: the zero-budget Willy's Wonderland, starring an unusually silent Nicolas Cage and some off-brand mascot beasties. That movie was pure junk, a transparent attempt to will a cult film into existence. But in its chintzy, bottom-dollar way, it better capitalized on the appeal of Five Nights at Freddy's: the retro-cheese-gone-bad vibes of the locale, the mechanical gait of the monsters, the sense of a nostalgic memory of family fun corrupted by unholy forces. This more polished, authorized take has the official Freddy seal, but little else going for it; the sadistic thrill of the game disappears under a mountain of plot. If it came first, there would be no Five Nights empire to exploit.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Freelance Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Freelance is a rarity in how dead it appears on arrival. Director Pierre Morel is a shell of the filmmaker who made action romps Taken and Peppermint; this lifeless action rom-ish-com fails every genre in its multi-hyphenate description. Writer Jacob Lentz’s thoughtless feature debut screenplay is a shambles of contradictory dialogue and forgotten plotlines whose thematic fumbles are fit for an ESPN Not Top 10 reel. At no point does anyone in front of or behind the camera seem to understand the movie they’re making. It’s a mess from start to finish, but not the fun type of disaster where bad turns to worse with entertaining discombobulation.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Freelance Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'John Cena stars as ex-special forces operative Mason Pettits. He’s injured in combat, becomes a numb-to-the-world lawyer, and then attempts to relocate his sense of purpose by accepting a private-security contract. Cena narrates an ugly first-person introduction in which Pettits dishes out military propaganda that explains why he enlisted instead of pursuing the wife-kids-and-white-picket-fence lifestyle. Are we supposed to laugh at how much he loathes the thought of living in the suburbs, like a “joke” about how he’d get bored and end up having an affair with his hot neighbor? It’s never clear because Freelance’s Dust Bowl-dry sense of humor isn’t witty enough to be sardonic nor obvious enough to be slapstick.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Freelance Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'It’s an awful introduction to a movie with limp convictions that starts with an unhappy veteran’s decision to chase mercenary work motivated by a pending divorce. Poor Alice Eve plays Pettits’ wife, who presents like a glitchy, AI-generated Lifetime Original Movie character who in a single conversation declares she’s “done” with her husband and suggests he should leave, then gets furious when he says he took a job overseas and will leave, then forgets all that and angrily tells him they’re dangerously close to over again. This carelessness is par for the course in Lentz’s amnesiac screenplay, which only worsens with the introduction of discouraged celebrity gossip journalist Claire Wellington (Alison Brie). Pettits is employed to provide protection services on Wellington’s trip to Paldonia, a war-torn, geographically ambiguous nation where she’ll interview a divisive dictator, President Juan Venegas (Juan Pablo Raba).'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Freelance Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': \"There’s a bounty of drama in Freelance that we should care about. For one, Pettits blames Venegas for an incident from a previous tour of duty, when Paldonian missiles shot down his transport chopper, killed half his squadron, and left him with chronic back issues. Christian Slater plays Pettits’ closest comrade from his special forces days and new boss – and he’s suspiciously the one who sends Pettits on a mission involving Venegas. The seeds of betrayal are planted, but Lentz doesn’t seem to have the attention span to see storytelling dynamics blossom into exceptional conclusions. Over and over, setups deflate upon payoff or are lazily discarded, like the devastating spinal damage that makes an opening fight scene painfully difficult for Pettits to complete – it's forgotten by the third act, in which Pettits is as agile as a gymnast (or, you know, a professional wrestler) with no physical repercussions.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Freelance Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Freelance is an eyesore of GoPro-style cinematography, horrendous digital effects, and uninspired action. There’s no moviemaking magic: stunt doubles hardly hide their identities, green-screened backgrounds come across like foliage-patterned shower curtains hung behind actors on horseback, and sets look like plywood replicas an inch away from exposing the sound stage beyond their borders. The visual composition of Freelance is unacceptably flat, with as much flavor as a mayonnaise glob between stale Wonder Bread slices. You can see all the seams as RPGs fire missiles on wires or pixelated helicopters crash into lush Paldonian jungle floors, as if post-production departments crammed all their assignments into the night before they were due.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Freelance Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': \"The only chuckles come from Cena and Raba forcing their charms through abysmally written character – Cena the Adonis action hero prototype, and Raba the (supposed) eccentric tyrant with a heart (and revolver) of gold. Cena and Brie have less sexual chemistry than Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham in Hobbs & Shaw, rendering any will-they/won’t-they as impotent as the majority of Freelance’s performances. Lentz and Morel are terrible when sustaining long-form storytelling, and Pettits, Venegas, and Wellington learn nothing because Freelance doesn’t teach lessons, it just reads the answers aloud. Depictions of corporate disgust, anarchistic coups, and senseless killing are lifelessly plastic, using the hardships that plague underdeveloped nations as a “zany” backdrop for a shoot-'em-up gone putrid.\"}\n",

The romantic back-and-forth where a journalist and bodyguard find their purposes (or temptations) entwined?

This is the all-consuming Cobweb of paranoia writer-director Kim Jee-woon explores with his audience, as hidden agendas, fragile egos, and mental breakdowns pour gasoline on the problems of moviemaking under a microscope in 1970s South Korea.  '}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Cobweb (Geomijip) Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'What follows is a combination of slapstick farce and character-driven drama. In a performance of extremes from Song, Ki-yeol suffers through stress-induced hallucinations, bone-dry moments of awkward comedy, and melodramatic clashes with Yu-rim, played to pampered perfection by Krystal Jung. Yu-rim stands her ground against the pushy director, giving Cobweb (not to be confused with the 2023 American horror film of the same title) some real substance early on before things go off the rails and writer-director Kim allows his film to drift towards self-indulgence in its collision of fictional worlds.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Cobweb (Geomijip) Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'That’s the main problem with Cobweb: a focus on creative process takes priority, leaving audiences without a story to distract them from the needless, ultimately overbearing display of visual showmanship. As much as Kim would like Cobweb to compete with Alejandro E. Inarritu’s Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) in terms of storytelling, it comes closer to James Franco’s The Disaster Artist in execution, if not subject matter. For some that might sound harsh, since Cobweb featured out of competition at Cannes this year and boasts solid performances from Im Soo-jung (reuniting with Kim after 2004’s A Tale of Two Sisters), as well as Jeon Yeo-been, making a formidable impression as the heir to studio head President Baek (Jang Young-Nam).'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Cobweb (Geomijip) Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'However, if Cobweb succeeds anywhere beyond those central performances, it comes through best in Kim’s desire to understand the importance of cinema for writer-directors such as himself – on this occasion, he seems to have used filmmaking as some form of therapy. He puts Ki-yeol in the crosshairs of narrow-minded politicians who see no value in cinema beyond a means of spreading propaganda. If he had allowed more of that to come through in Cobweb, then this might have become a film with something original to say about the state of censorship. Sadly, it turns into an exercise in self-indulgence that will leave most audiences wondering about the point he’s trying to make.   '}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Cobweb (Geomijip) Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'It is a shame Kim decided to take things in a direction that adds little value beyond showcasing cinematic techniques. When the chaos created by a closed set fails to make people laugh in its final minutes, Cobweb turns into a claustrophobic scramble for closure that undermines any political statements, leaving an audience oblivious to the underlying message. All the preceding scenes of slapstick that concealed something more serious beneath the surface lose their power when technical razzle-dazzle overshadows everything else. Numerous obstacles may stand between an exasperated Ki-yeol and his efforts to finish a film that never measures up to the masterpiece in his mind, but as events inevitably escalate, Cobweb reveals itself to be nothing more than an exercise in style over substance.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The End We Start From Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Dystopian films about the end of the world have to balance on their precarious tightrope the terrifying threat of extinction and the human resilience that fuels an almost unshakeable sense of hope. There is no better catalyst for hope than a reminder of the possibilities of a future, and no better reminder of the future than children. Think Alfonso Cuarón’s seminal Children of Men or John Hillcoat’s The Road, two dystopian stories that see ordinary men turn into heroes thanks to a primal desire to defend and protect the children under their care.'}\n",

An unnamed mother (Jodie Comer) is forced into early labor when water comes crashing down through the gaping windows of her London townhouse. The water, it turns out, won’t stop coming. With London now submerged, the mother, father R (Joel Fry), and their newborn daughter head out to the countryside, where R’s family lives in a rustic cottage with a fully stocked pantry and fertile ground able to keep their mouths full and their bodies strong. This being a post-apocalyptic drama, their idyllic life in the country can’t last, of course, and soon tragedy comes knocking on their door, breaking apart the family and sending mother and baby on their own journey of survival.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The End We Start From Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'In her novel The End We Start From, author Megan Hunter doesn’t say much about the ecological disaster that renders a global city unlivable, nor does she reveal if the same thing has happened anywhere else. The screenplay adaptation by Alice Birch follows that lead; as director, Belo decides instead to translate literary prose through visual contemplation, with the mother encapsulating the emotional torment of facing the unknown while carrying a small baby in her arms. The film’s greatest triumph lies in the casting of Jodie Comer, an actress capable of communicating even the slightest change of psychological gears, just as effective in moments of passion shared between two lovers as she is while standing on the precipice of oblivion.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The End We Start From Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Comer is joined by Elisabeth Waterston as a fellow mother at an emergency shelter, Mark Strong as R’s loving dad, and executive producer Benedict Cumberbatch as a soulful nomad. While the latter two have only brief cameos, Waterston slides into the spot of spirited sidekick, punctuating moments of dread with little quips about the not-so-rose-tinted realities of motherhood. It’s a relationship that grows quickly tiresome, the quiet, mourning mother and the one-dimensional friend who exists only to provide the lead character with glaringly manufactured interactions to bring up her backstory. We know as little about the lives of the supporting characters as we know about London’s sudden transformation into an open-air aquarium, and such a disconnect makes it hard to feel for their shortcomings.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The End We Start From Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'And here lies the Achilles heel of Belo’s debut: by favoring muted meditation over a much-needed pinch of dramatic exposure, The End We Start From lacks an emotional pull. We never get to witness the blood-chilling terror of the flood nor are we allowed the time to feel for the people whose lives have been so abruptly uprooted. All attempts to establish sympathy with the mother come from her position as, well, a mother, or hurried flashbacks employed as a crutch whenever the story hits one of its many dead ends. Such aimlessness muddles the film’s timing: while the second act drags endlessly, the conclusion feels rushed, with characters coming in and out of the story with little justification for their existence apart from, of course, advancing the mother’s journey.

      "{'Title': 'The End We Start From Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'By the time a much-teased reunion comes, it feels a bit too little, too late. Patience, it turns out, is a scarce commodity too, and it is tricky to chase down a reward in The End We Start From’s haystack of frustration. It’s a shame, because Belo occasionally captures a glimpse of raw humanity: in the very few moments where Comer gets to dwell on the grief that accompanies motherhood, or the losses that come with beginnings as much as with endings. For just a second, we get to fully comprehend the magnitude of what is at stake.'}\n",

Possibly too much. As a period piece fascinated by American talk shows and demonic possession, it’s eager to show its homework. It takes great pains to capture the funky aesthetic of ’70s TV (people in sideburns! Who smoke on set!) and then saddles this groovy costume party with a cultural zeitgeist that paints the story in a grimmer context. It employs practical gore effects that are so charmingly gross that when it starts dressing them up with weaker digital effects, the results sap the low-budget magic. '}\n",

Something has to be done to save Jack’s soul – er, show. '}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Late Night with the Devil Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Late Night with the Devil’s found-footage framework kicks off with a six-minute pseudo-documentary montage in which Michael Ironside narrates Delroy’s rise and seemingly imminent fall. “America in the 1970s: An era of mistrust,” Ironside growls, priming us for the on-air chicanery that beaten-down Delroy will soon resort to. Naturally, shots of Richard Nixon’s resignation make an appearance. To belabor this seamy (silly) mood, footage of various killers such as David Berkowitz, Charles Manson, and Ted Bundy are spliced in. Peppered throughout this sequence, as though what we’ve just seen isn’t heavy-handed enough, are images of social upheaval and, more pertinently, Satanism, the era’s favorite source of irrational panic and, clearly, the film’s big hook. The Cairnes aim to blend the devil with the broken spirit of the ’70s; in their zealousness, they only manage an info dump.'}\n",

He’s TV’s genial Midwestern alternative to Johnny Carson’s metropolitan swagger, but the ratings for his show, “Night Owls,” are in the toilet. In desperation, Jack and his hard-drinking producer, Leo (Josh Quong Tart), gin up sensationalist drivel to vie for audience attention. Jack arm wrestles little people and pits draft dodgers against returning soldiers, a veritable Jerry Springer of his time. Purposefully, his onstage antics echo late-night history, like when Madonna went on David Letterman to let Ol’ Dave have it with a few choice expletives. (There’s also a nod to Burt Reynolds’s Tonight Show water fight with Marc Summers.)

There’s also the Andy Richter to Jack’s Conan, Gus (Rhys Auteri), the faithful sidekick/announcer who’s more pious than showbiz (or Jack) wants him to be. As the night progresses, guests bicker over the existence of the supernatural and then, perplexingly, civility (or the lack of it, in Charmichael’s case). Strange things begin to stack up. Details concerning Jack’s ambition (and the movie’s lore) simmer offstage.

This comparison would be unfair if The Cairnes weren’t so clearly repackaging its gimmick. Ghostwatch aired on the BBC on Halloween night in 1992, employing real television anchors to give the special an air of legitimacy – to the degree that some viewers believed the ghost story unfolding before their eyes was true. Late Night uses real-life horrors to give it some additional color, but it has more fun dabbling in fantasy. Once the chairs begin to float, the movie has shown its hand. The head of subtlety just spins and spins.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Late Night with the Devil Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Still, it’s an amusing enough spectacle to watch unravel. Dastmalchian is sharp casting; his passion for regional late-night horror hosts is well documented (he created the Dark Horse Comics series Count Crowley in tribute to them), and his charming peculiarities shimmer beneath the unctuous persona of Jack Delroy. (“Where’s Vincent Price when you need him?” he brays to the crowd.) Bliss is a terrific foil for everyone on stage; he’s such an effective asshole that watching him puff on his cigar – after he makes a show of producing it from thin air – is a riot unto itself. He makes everyone squirm (quite literally at one point), and the movie is all the better for it. Torelli has a presence that is just as eerie as the doomed girl she plays. '}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Late Night with the Devil Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'But while Late Night with the Devil captures the smoky late-’70s miasma through convincing enough set design, its cinematography is less committed to authenticity. The video effects and color grading capture the generic horror-throwback/video-store aesthetics that overcrowd Tubi. But it’s during the black-and-white backstage sequences that the otherwise sturdy artifice shatters completely. While these scenes reveal crucial story details, it just doesn’t seem likely that Jack would speak so candidly to Leo, June, and Gus with a rolling camera in his face – or two, for that matter, as coverage has clearly been shot for these backstage chats that go well beyond typical “archival” footage. That prickliness to get its point across extends to the dialogue, which is so leaden that it dulls talk TV’s off-the-cuff snap and sounds more like a stage play – though, it should be said, the script would adapt into a great one.

      "{'Title': 'Sky Peals Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': ' Grieving for something you have already lost is quite an odd thing – a death that kills twice. It’s a type of mourning that often uncovers painful possibilities, unfinished conversations, and a vast collection of “What if?”s. It is also what kickstarts Adam’s (Faraz Ayub) journey in Moin Hussain’s feature debut, Sky Peals. A service station worker, Adam arrives home one late evening after his shift to a message from his father, Hassan (Jeff Mirza). The thing is, Adam hasn’t seen or heard from his father in over two decades, since the day he walked out of the door never to return to the family home he shared with his wife and young son. '}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Sky Peals Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'It’s not long after his father’s missed call that Adam hears of his death. Years after losing his father as a young boy, Adam loses him again as a grown man, the sudden wave of grief bringing up traumas he’d hid safely under a blanket of denial. Hassan’s death reunites Adam not only with troubled patches of his past but also with his estranged father’s family. The reunion is a painful walk down memory lane, and the more the man learns about his late father, the more he questions himself. Such an overwhelming wave of information proves hard to navigate, and soon the emotional impact finds a physical escape valve in suffocating panic attacks paired with disorienting bouts of amnesia.  '}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Sky Peals Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Adam is never explicitly given a neurodivergence diagnosis, but one is strongly implied. Sound design is used to amplify the deafening nature of crowded spaces, a feeling complemented by Nick Cooke’s skilful cinematography. Narrow corridors and dark office spaces contract around Adam like traps and overexposed lights glare brighter and brighter to cause a severe sense of disorientation. The service station acts as a limbo, a place that could be nowhere and everywhere, suspended in the middle of the night. There, Adam finds pockets of safety within the chaos, be it a few minutes inside the walk-in freezer of the shabby fast food outpost where he works at or a quiet moment up the escalator as the whirring of the rolling belt plays a calming lullaby.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Sky Peals Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'In this grasp of Adam’s particular experience of the world and those in it, Sky Peals plays as a moving – and greatly sensitive – portrayal of neurodivergence, even if it dodges labels in the process. Hussain’s understanding of the emotional fabric of his main character is so refined it doesn’t need to appeal to rejection to make a point of how detached Adam feels from life around him. The people in Adam’s life offer him nothing but kindness, from his mother’s (Claire Rushbrook) loving way of pushing him out of the nest to his boss’ (Steve Oram) nurturing management, rooted in a deep belief in Adam’s professional merits. Hassan’s family brings his orphaned son under their wing, looking fondly at the past while always making sure to discuss the possibilities of a future. '}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Sky Peals Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': \"Newcomer Ayub finds great beauty in moments of stillness, curling into himself to communicate the excruciating pain of overstimulation and beaming his big brown eyes at people as he tries to navigate tricky social interactions. Alongside him, the always brilliant Rushbrook makes the most of the few scenes she's in, speaking honestly about the heartbreak of being abandoned and having to raise a small boy in a strange town after being plucked from home by a man who had no intentions to raise a family alongside her. This unfiltered dynamic between mother and son, a relationship built on truthfulness even when uncomfortable, is the loveliest pairing in a film that dedicates breathing time to exploring companionship and empathy in its many different forms.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Sky Peals Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Much attention has been paid to the recent British wave of coming-of-age debuts, from Charlotte Wells’ Aftersun to Molly Manning Walker’s How to Have Sex. Not so much attention has been paid, however, to how first-time British filmmakers have made beautifully nuanced films about the complexities of the country’s diaspora in the last couple of years. In 2023 alone, the subject has been tackled by satire (Naqqash Khalid’s In Camera), horror (Paris Zarcilla’s Raging Grace) and Hussain’s moving foray into magical realism. This willingness to tap into the grief that comes from cultural and geographical displacement to reflect on isolation allows Hussain to build a moving portrayal of otherness as its own form of grief.'}\n",

But putting Ginger, Rocky, Bunty, and Babs back in action without the original's full cast onboard feels like the first in a long line of mistakes being made in Dawn of the Nugget. The result is a paltry sequel that only highlights what audiences loved about its predecessor.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Comparisons with the first film are unavoidable, and Dawn of the Nugget feels more like a Bargain Bucket than any type of stop-motion Happy Meal, as a very slim story gets padded out to feature length. Thandiwe Newton and Zachary Levi do their best to fill in for Julia Sawalha and Mel Gibson in the roles of Ginger and Rocky, but Sawalha and Gibson’s absence is felt throughout a film whose stakes feel threadbare. With their daughter Molly (Bella Ramsey) providing an essential kick start to the story, Dawn of the Nugget falls back on formula fast to create obstacles for this plucky teenager to overcome.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Beyond the disappointment of a pedestrian plot – which sees the intrepid chickens attempt their own smash and grab – this sequel succeeds in packing movie references in at every opportunity, from the obvious Mission: Impossible nods to any number of throwbacks to Bond villains’ lairs, where complicated security measures are overcome by common sense and a smart catchphrase.  With the freedom to fashion household objects into weird and wonderful contraptions, Dawn of the Nugget also trades in Chicken Run nostalgia, as crude catapults create a stop-motion spectacle sending our feathered friends into a fortified factory farm packed with peril. '}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Highlights amongst the returning cast include Miranda Richardson and Jane Horrocks, who breathe life back into Mrs. Tweedy and Babs with some inspired voice work that elevates every moment of screen time they’re given. In the case of Mrs. Tweedy, that sense of pantomime villainy has been cranked up to 11, as the overbearing farmer injects Dawn of the Nugget with a sense of childlike terror alongside some psychedelic visuals that feel more Austin Powers than 007 by design. Babs, on the other hand, might be a few seconds behind everyone else, but Horrocks has perfect comic timing and knows how to deliver a punchline on cue, armed with nothing but a pair of needles and writers who can pull solid-gold sight gags from her knitting.  '}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Unfortunately, Newton and Levi lack the chemistry of Sawalha and Gibson, and seem to spend their time overshadowed by the original leads. In hindsight, the decision to recast Rocky seems sensible, since Gibson circa 2023 no longer fits a family image in the traditional sense, but to replace Sawalha feels more like a marketing ploy than an issue of public perception. Dawn of the Nugget is made no easier to enjoy due to a lack of originality from Kirkpatrick, O’Farrell, and Tunnard, who have simply gone back over old ground with an animated classic that should have been left alone. Although there is no faulting the top-tier animation on display, there is no avoiding the fact that nuggets of any kind were unnecessary.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'With a wafer-thin story and need to recast essential characters, Dawn of the Nugget fails to hit the heights of Chicken Run by avoiding anything risky. For the sequel to impress audiences, Aardman needed to reinvent the wheel, combining Oscar-winning animators and an excited writing team prepared to push their story somewhere new. What they delivered instead is a film that will slip by unnoticed on Netflix, except for parents looking to distract their children on a Sunday afternoon.'}\n",

      "{'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Some dystopias leap into fantastical futures with just a hint of the present societal malaise. The children battling to the death in The Hunger Games, the Kafkaeqsque insanity of Brazil, or the far-reaching stupidity of Idiocracy all poke at contemporary sins through extreme flights of fancy. But for Daniel Kaluuya and Kibwe Taveres’ The Kitchen, the nightmare feels mere moments away.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'In this speculative near future, the UK has outlawed all social housing, but a vast London estate called The Kitchen has resisted being decimated. Its residents have formed a community spiritually led by Lord Kitchener (a rare acting turn by charismatic former footballer and broadcast fixture Ian Wright) and come together to feed and protect one another. The communal areas are filled with makeshift shops and restaurants, forming a lively bazaar that is part Blade Runner and Brixton Market. Residents come together for roller disco nights, rap battles, and to show off their bike skills in stark contrast to the rest of the city, which is pristine but desolate. Few people walk its streets and wealth has scrubbed away any personality to create an inhuman cacophony of charmless skyscrapers.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': \"Izi (Kane Robinson) is a resident of The Kitchen who works in a horrifying futuristic funeral home in the city's center that takes those too poor to afford proper burials and turns their remains into soil for plants. He works on commission and sees no problem manipulating potential clients into purchasing additional “fond farewell packages,” guilting them into not being a burden even after they tell their offspring “I don’t want to be a fucking bush!” But the nightmare of being too poor to die is only glanced at; the film’s beating heart is in The Kitchen, laying bare how a community finds the strength to endure occupation and the delegitimization of its existence.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': \"Izi is a compelling antihero, a resident of The Kitchen with one foot perpetually out of the door. He’s internalized some of the rhetoric about the estate, continually referring to it as a “shithole.” Admittedly, the water rarely works, electricity is unreliable, and the residents are subjected to frequent brutality at the hands of the police – but as his colleague Jase reminds him, “That’s them, not us”. At the funeral home, he meets a teenage boy called Benji (Jedaiah Bannerman), the sole attendee at his mother’s funeral who cannot bring himself to form parting words during her service. It transpires Benji’s mother was someone Izi once knew and despite an inauspicious introduction (“It’s your mum’s funeral. I get it. I don’t want to have to tell you to fuck off”), Izi steps in to help Benji out and he too ends up as a resident of The Kitchen. He's also embraced by a local gang of bike-riding activists who will do whatever it takes to protect their home.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'While there’s not much reflection on the technological advancements that have taken place in The Kitchen’s vision of tomorrow, it provides a striking portrait of a clear and present danger. The nightmarish raids on the building are forewarned by the community leaning out of their windows and clanging on pots and pans in a dark parallel of the celebrations done for first responders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The residents then have mere moments to barricade themselves in their homes before the police rain terror upon their homes and bodies. But despite this brutal reality, they believe they can exist as long as Lord Kitchener assures them, “We doesn’t become I.”'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': \"The political statement of the piece is clear. Still, it doesn’t become overly didactic, with its emotional core of  Izi and Benji's evolving relationship punctuated by kinetic action sequences where the residents of The Kitchen strike out against their oppressors. The social constructs that separate crime from law enforcement are flipped, heists becoming acts of heroism and “justice” reframed as the violence perpetrated in service of the privileged few. There are moments that visualize how reductive notions of “Britishness” have cursed this wider landscape: a single Saint George’s flag waving in the breeze from a  balcony; drones surveilling citizens with inhuman detachment. These are the artful ways The Kitchen challenges its audience's preconceptions of the charming cinematic London that Richard Curtis, Mary Poppins, and Bridget Jones set in amber.\"}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'What makes The Kitchen such a truly impressive feature debut is that it is also such a pleasure to spend time visiting. The dialogue is concise but frequently hilarious. Even with a taciturn lead character, Robinson makes all of his dialogue sing, and moments like Izi and Benji simply discussing the merits of a lamp are utterly enchanting. The aesthetic is just delicious, from the brutalist architecture that frames each flat as a vibrant portrait to the shimmering jewel tones of the parties that light Black skin with a preternatural glow that evokes modern classics Moonlight and City of God.'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'The dynamics built in the slim 98-minute runtime are as formidable as The Kitchen itself. Izi and Benji’s relationship evolves with all the delicacy of Kramer vs. Kramer and Paper Moon, entering into a tender synchronicity as their story progresses. But their bond and the world of The Kitchen cannot exist in a bubble. And no matter how well-intentioned those at its center are, invading forces must be reckoned with. '}\n",
      "{'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN', 'Paragraph': 'Aptly, The Kitchen ends on a challenging note; it may be possible to win a battle, but this is part of a much larger and insurmountable war. As the audience, we are reminded of the very human cost of this dystopia, and how for many across the globe, the speculative horrors of The Kitchen are a cruel reality.'}\n"

       "  'Paragraph': 'Divinity, the fifth film by Eddie Alcazar, is a strange and propulsive curio. Part retrofuturistic sci-fi, part meditation on masculine form (and shot entirely in black-and-white), it has the kind of plot you can only half-describe on paper, but its oblique genre musings are presented in alluring and esoteric fashion, making it hard to look away. Inventor and marketer Jaxxon Pierce (Stephen Dorff) creates an immortality serum that changes the world as we know it, but this incurs the wrath of supernaturally powered beings from… somewhere, and somewhen. Earth? A distant galaxy? Centuries in the future? It’s hard to be sure. Divinity isn’t concerned with these details, but rather with the anxieties surrounding mortality in the modern world. These pieces don’t always fit together, and they can be frustrating to interpret, but the result is never boring, thanks to images you’ve likely never seen assembled this way.'},\n",

Most of the movie unfolds decades later, after Sterling’s sons – the business-minded Jaxxon and the aptly-named bodybuilder Rip (Michael O'Hearn) – have perfected their father’s formula, which they’ve dubbed “Divinity,” and turned it into a global industry. It is, however, intentionally difficult to tell when the story is set, thanks to the design sensibilities Jaxxon’s lavish home, which combines mid-century modern furnishings with screens out of the 1980s and some much more recent technology. It feels like a film out of time, which is precisely the vibe given off by its two groups of otherworldly humanoids, who seldom interact but have their own distinct missions.\"},\n",

There’s a godlike benevolence to Ziva, her clan, and the gentle light that envelops them – but it’s hard to tell if these are human women at all, rather than some sort of extraterrestrial lifeforms or even psychic manifestations whose words seem to echo endlessly.'},\n",

Once the brothers make their way to Jaxxon’s residence, they capture him with the use of Star Trek-esque stun guns and speak almost in riddles about the moral havoc Jaxxon either has caused, or will cause – the details are left vague. (Similarly obscured: The enraging secret source of Divinity, which they discover in his lab.)

Its action-heavy climax involves highly detailed prosthetics and stop-motion trickery; the whole endeavor plays like a Twilight Zone episode about rebirth as written by a Rod Serling who’s hopped up on techno and MDMA.

In frank voiceover, the titular assassin (Michael Fassbender, in his first feature since 2019’s Dark Phoenix), relates thoughts that span from quotes to live by (some with attribution, others' authors forgotten) to job-focused tactics to the mantra that keeps him focused. “Stick to the plan. Trust no one. Anticipate, don't improvise. Fight only the battle you're paid to fight.” He speaks of what he calls “the void of life,” and how his ability to recognize it sets him apart – not one of the many, but the few.\"},\n",

The Killer is a return to form for Fincher, who has made meals of these kinds of stories in the past, but with this film, he expertly lays bare how untouchability is dismantled by emotion, and how that can force even the most calculated into a quest for a kind of absolution – even a bloody one.

Despite being a destroyer of worlds, the killer is, at least, truthful in his thoughts, and it allows the audience to root for him as a complicated protagonist. We meet him keeping watch meticulously, doing Patrick Bateman-style yoga in a run-down hideout disguised as a Parisian WeWork.

Tilda Swinton has a small part in the film, but it's nevertheless a pivotal one, and she perfectly embodies the qualities of wise and seasoned yet resigned. To give anything further away about her character would be a spoiler, but it’s a delight to see her show up in this story, even for just a scene.

With the ending Fincher and Walker give to the titular killer, full of satisfaction and a prescient calm after the storm, it seems like he may have gotten his wish. As for us?

Created by the Jim Henson Creature Shop, they naturally look pretty cool – both faithful to the game design and credible, physical machinery, like something you might have scarring memories of seeing in the '80s or '90s. But the movie doesn't seem entirely sure of how scary it's allowed to make them. Yes, tweens will see this PG-13 horror movie, but they also play the games, and the robots are rather frightening there – in part, it must be said, because you only ever see them locked in staring place, waiting for you to look away before they move again, à la those statue phantoms from Doctor Who. Here, they kind of lumber around like Barney, shedding menace by the heavy footstep. And the movie makes a huge miscalculation in turning them into misunderstood monsters, with an origin story that's technically from the games but deflating in adaptation.\"},\n",

That movie was pure junk, a transparent attempt to will a cult film into existence. But in its chintzy, bottom-dollar way, it better capitalized on the appeal of Five Nights at Freddy's: the retro-cheese-gone-bad vibes of the locale, the mechanical gait of the monsters, the sense of a nostalgic memory of family fun corrupted by unholy forces. This more polished, authorized take has the official Freddy seal, but little else going for it; the sadistic thrill of the game disappears under a mountain of plot. If it came first, there would be no Five Nights empire to exploit.\"},\n",

Director Pierre Morel is a shell of the filmmaker who made action romps Taken and Peppermint; this lifeless action rom-ish-com fails every genre in its multi-hyphenate description. Writer Jacob Lentz’s thoughtless feature debut screenplay is a shambles of contradictory dialogue and forgotten plotlines whose thematic fumbles are fit for an ESPN Not Top 10 reel.

He’s injured in combat, becomes a numb-to-the-world lawyer, and then attempts to relocate his sense of purpose by accepting a private-security contract. Cena narrates an ugly first-person introduction in which Pettits dishes out military propaganda that explains why he enlisted instead of pursuing the wife-kids-and-white-picket-fence lifestyle. Are we supposed to laugh at how much he loathes the thought of living in the suburbs, like a “joke” about how he’d get bored and end up having an affair with his hot neighbor?

This carelessness is par for the course in Lentz’s amnesiac screenplay, which only worsens with the introduction of discouraged celebrity gossip journalist Claire Wellington (Alison Brie). Pettits is employed to provide protection services on Wellington’s trip to Paldonia, a war-torn, geographically ambiguous nation where she’ll interview a divisive dictator, President Juan Venegas (Juan Pablo Raba).'},\n",

For one, Pettits blames Venegas for an incident from a previous tour of duty, when Paldonian missiles shot down his transport chopper, killed half his squadron, and left him with chronic back issues. Christian Slater plays Pettits’ closest comrade from his special forces days and new boss – and he’s suspiciously the one who sends Pettits on a mission involving Venegas. The seeds of betrayal are planted, but Lentz doesn’t seem to have the attention span to see storytelling dynamics blossom into exceptional conclusions. Over and over, setups deflate upon payoff or are lazily discarded, like the devastating spinal damage that makes an opening fight scene painfully difficult for Pettits to complete – it's forgotten by the third act, in which Pettits is as agile as a gymnast (or, you know, a professional wrestler) with no physical repercussions.\"},\n",

The visual composition of Freelance is unacceptably flat, with as much flavor as a mayonnaise glob between stale Wonder Bread slices.

Lentz and Morel are terrible when sustaining long-form storytelling, and Pettits, Venegas, and Wellington learn nothing because Freelance doesn’t teach lessons, it just reads the answers aloud.

Yu-rim stands her ground against the pushy director, giving Cobweb (not to be confused with the 2023 American horror film of the same title) some real substance early on before things go off the rails and writer-director Kim allows his film to drift towards self-indulgence in its collision of fictional worlds.'},\n",

As much as Kim would like Cobweb to compete with Alejandro E.

For some that might sound harsh, since Cobweb featured out of competition at Cannes this year and boasts solid performances from Im Soo-jung (reuniting with Kim after 2004’s A Tale of Two Sisters), as well as Jeon Yeo-been, making a formidable impression as the heir to studio head President Baek (Jang Young-Nam).'},\n",

He puts Ki-yeol in the crosshairs of narrow-minded politicians who see no value in cinema beyond a means of spreading propaganda. If he had allowed more of that to come through in Cobweb, then this might have become a film with something original to say about the state of censorship.

All the preceding scenes of slapstick that concealed something more serious beneath the surface lose their power when technical razzle-dazzle overshadows everything else. Numerous obstacles may stand between an exasperated Ki-yeol and his efforts to finish a film that never measures up to the masterpiece in his mind, but as events inevitably escalate, Cobweb reveals itself to be nothing more than an exercise in style over substance.'},\n",

The screenplay adaptation by Alice Birch follows that lead; as director, Belo decides instead to translate literary prose through visual contemplation, with the mother encapsulating the emotional torment of facing the unknown while carrying a small baby in her arms.

While the latter two have only brief cameos, Waterston slides into the spot of spirited sidekick, punctuating moments of dread with little quips about the not-so-rose-tinted realities of motherhood. It’s a relationship that grows quickly tiresome, the quiet, mourning mother and the one-dimensional friend who exists only to provide the lead character with glaringly manufactured interactions to bring up her backstory.

We never get to witness the blood-chilling terror of the flood nor are we allowed the time to feel for the people whose lives have been so abruptly uprooted. All attempts to establish sympathy with the mother come from her position as, well, a mother, or hurried flashbacks employed as a crutch whenever the story hits one of its many dead ends. Such aimlessness muddles the film’s timing: while the second act drags endlessly, the conclusion feels rushed, with characters coming in and out of the story with little justification for their existence apart from, of course, advancing the mother’s journey.

It takes great pains to capture the funky aesthetic of ’70s TV (people in sideburns!

Naturally, shots of Richard Nixon’s resignation make an appearance. To belabor this seamy (silly) mood, footage of various killers such as David Berkowitz, Charles Manson, and Ted Bundy are spliced in. Peppered throughout this sequence, as though what we’ve just seen isn’t heavy-handed enough, are images of social upheaval and, more pertinently, Satanism, the era’s favorite source of irrational panic and, clearly, the film’s big hook.

Ghostwatch aired on the BBC on Halloween night in 1992, employing real television anchors to give the special an air of legitimacy – to the degree that some viewers believed the ghost story unfolding before their eyes was true.

       "  'Paragraph': 'Unfortunately, Newton and Levi lack the chemistry of Sawalha and Gibson, and seem to spend their time overshadowed by the original leads. In hindsight, the decision to recast Rocky seems sensible, since Gibson circa 2023 no longer fits a family image in the traditional sense, but to replace Sawalha feels more like a marketing ploy than an issue of public perception. Dawn of the Nugget is made no easier to enjoy due to a lack of originality from Kirkpatrick, O’Farrell, and Tunnard, who have simply gone back over old ground with an animated classic that should have been left alone. Although there is no faulting the top-tier animation on display, there is no avoiding the fact that nuggets of any kind were unnecessary.'},\n",
       " {'Title': 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget Review - IGN',\n",
       "  'Paragraph': 'With a wafer-thin story and need to recast essential characters, Dawn of the Nugget fails to hit the heights of Chicken Run by avoiding anything risky. For the sequel to impress audiences, Aardman needed to reinvent the wheel, combining Oscar-winning animators and an excited writing team prepared to push their story somewhere new. What they delivered instead is a film that will slip by unnoticed on Netflix, except for parents looking to distract their children on a Sunday afternoon.'},\n",

       " {'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN',\n",
       "  'Paragraph': 'Some dystopias leap into fantastical futures with just a hint of the present societal malaise. The children battling to the death in The Hunger Games, the Kafkaeqsque insanity of Brazil, or the far-reaching stupidity of Idiocracy all poke at contemporary sins through extreme flights of fancy. But for Daniel Kaluuya and Kibwe Taveres’ The Kitchen, the nightmare feels mere moments away.'},\n",
       " {'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN',\n",
       "  'Paragraph': 'In this speculative near future, the UK has outlawed all social housing, but a vast London estate called The Kitchen has resisted being decimated. Its residents have formed a community spiritually led by Lord Kitchener (a rare acting turn by charismatic former footballer and broadcast fixture Ian Wright) and come together to feed and protect one another. The communal areas are filled with makeshift shops and restaurants, forming a lively bazaar that is part Blade Runner and Brixton Market. Residents come together for roller disco nights, rap battles, and to show off their bike skills in stark contrast to the rest of the city, which is pristine but desolate. Few people walk its streets and wealth has scrubbed away any personality to create an inhuman cacophony of charmless skyscrapers.'},\n",
       " {'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN',\n",
       "  'Paragraph': \"Izi (Kane Robinson) is a resident of The Kitchen who works in a horrifying futuristic funeral home in the city's center that takes those too poor to afford proper burials and turns their remains into soil for plants. He works on commission and sees no problem manipulating potential clients into purchasing additional “fond farewell packages,” guilting them into not being a burden even after they tell their offspring “I don’t want to be a fucking bush!” But the nightmare of being too poor to die is only glanced at; the film’s beating heart is in The Kitchen, laying bare how a community finds the strength to endure occupation and the delegitimization of its existence.\"},\n",
       " {'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN',\n",
       "  'Paragraph': \"Izi is a compelling antihero, a resident of The Kitchen with one foot perpetually out of the door. He’s internalized some of the rhetoric about the estate, continually referring to it as a “shithole.” Admittedly, the water rarely works, electricity is unreliable, and the residents are subjected to frequent brutality at the hands of the police – but as his colleague Jase reminds him, “That’s them, not us”. At the funeral home, he meets a teenage boy called Benji (Jedaiah Bannerman), the sole attendee at his mother’s funeral who cannot bring himself to form parting words during her service. It transpires Benji’s mother was someone Izi once knew and despite an inauspicious introduction (“It’s your mum’s funeral. I get it. I don’t want to have to tell you to fuck off”), Izi steps in to help Benji out and he too ends up as a resident of The Kitchen. He's also embraced by a local gang of bike-riding activists who will do whatever it takes to protect their home.\"},\n",
       " {'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN',\n",
       "  'Paragraph': 'While there’s not much reflection on the technological advancements that have taken place in The Kitchen’s vision of tomorrow, it provides a striking portrait of a clear and present danger. The nightmarish raids on the building are forewarned by the community leaning out of their windows and clanging on pots and pans in a dark parallel of the celebrations done for first responders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The residents then have mere moments to barricade themselves in their homes before the police rain terror upon their homes and bodies. But despite this brutal reality, they believe they can exist as long as Lord Kitchener assures them, “We doesn’t become I.”'},\n",
       " {'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN',\n",
       "  'Paragraph': \"The political statement of the piece is clear. Still, it doesn’t become overly didactic, with its emotional core of  Izi and Benji's evolving relationship punctuated by kinetic action sequences where the residents of The Kitchen strike out against their oppressors. The social constructs that separate crime from law enforcement are flipped, heists becoming acts of heroism and “justice” reframed as the violence perpetrated in service of the privileged few. There are moments that visualize how reductive notions of “Britishness” have cursed this wider landscape: a single Saint George’s flag waving in the breeze from a  balcony; drones surveilling citizens with inhuman detachment. These are the artful ways The Kitchen challenges its audience's preconceptions of the charming cinematic London that Richard Curtis, Mary Poppins, and Bridget Jones set in amber.\"},\n",
       " {'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN',\n",
       "  'Paragraph': 'What makes The Kitchen such a truly impressive feature debut is that it is also such a pleasure to spend time visiting. The dialogue is concise but frequently hilarious. Even with a taciturn lead character, Robinson makes all of his dialogue sing, and moments like Izi and Benji simply discussing the merits of a lamp are utterly enchanting. The aesthetic is just delicious, from the brutalist architecture that frames each flat as a vibrant portrait to the shimmering jewel tones of the parties that light Black skin with a preternatural glow that evokes modern classics Moonlight and City of God.'},\n",
       " {'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN',\n",
       "  'Paragraph': 'The dynamics built in the slim 98-minute runtime are as formidable as The Kitchen itself. Izi and Benji’s relationship evolves with all the delicacy of Kramer vs. Kramer and Paper Moon, entering into a tender synchronicity as their story progresses. But their bond and the world of The Kitchen cannot exist in a bubble. And no matter how well-intentioned those at its center are, invading forces must be reckoned with. '},\n",
       " {'Title': 'The Kitchen Review - IGN',\n",
       "  'Paragraph': 'Aptly, The Kitchen ends on a challenging note; it may be possible to win a battle, but this is part of a much larger and insurmountable war. As the audience, we are reminded of the very human cost of this dystopia, and how for many across the globe, the speculative horrors of The Kitchen are a cruel reality.'}]"
