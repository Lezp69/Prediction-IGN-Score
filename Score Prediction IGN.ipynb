      "{'Title': \"It's a Wonderful Knife Review - IGN\", 'Score': '8', 'Paragraph': 'It’s a Wonderful Knife is an excellent title for a Christmas slasher movie. So excellent, it’s surprising no one thought of it before. (That’s the sign of a good pun – it seems obvious, even inevitable.) Unfortunately, nothing else about the film matches that level of inspiration.'}\n",
      "{'Title': \"It's a Wonderful Knife Review - IGN\", 'Score': '8', 'Paragraph': 'The opening sequence glows with the warm incandescent light of a Hallmark or Lifetime Christmas movie, introducing an idyllic town square full of smiling citizens in festive sweaters to match. Angel Falls is celebrating its annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony, and everything seems perfect – at least on the surface. (Behind the scenes, there’s some family drama going on, but that’s not really important.) Then “The Angel,” an anonymous killer in a white cape and smooth, featureless white mask, appears at a raucous Christmas Eve party attended by our ostensible lead, Cara (Hana Huggins). Given that this is a slasher movie, it’s not hard to guess what happens next.'}\n",
      "{'Title': \"It's a Wonderful Knife Review - IGN\", 'Score': '8', 'Paragraph': 'Fifteen minutes in, a title card appears on screen, and the real story begins. As it turns out, Cara is not the protagonist of It’s a Wonderful Knife – her BFF Winnie (Jane Widdop) is. A year has passed since Cara’s artfully staged murder at the aforementioned party, and Winnie is appalled by her family’s reluctance to talk about what happened. So she storms off, like the angsty adolescent she is.'}\n",

Are we supposed to laugh at how much he loathes the thought of living in the suburbs, like a “joke” about how he’d get bored and end up having an affair with his hot neighbor?

This carelessness is par for the course in Lentz’s amnesiac screenplay, which only worsens with the introduction of discouraged celebrity gossip journalist Claire Wellington (Alison Brie).

Christian Slater plays Pettits’ closest comrade from his special forces days and new boss – and he’s suspiciously the one who sends Pettits on a mission involving Venegas. The seeds of betrayal are planted, but Lentz doesn’t seem to have the attention span to see storytelling dynamics blossom into exceptional conclusions. Over and over, setups deflate upon payoff or are lazily discarded, like the devastating spinal damage that makes an opening fight scene painfully difficult for Pettits to complete – it's forgotten by the third act, in which Pettits is as agile as a gymnast (or, you know, a professional wrestler) with no physical repercussions.\"}\n",

The visual composition of Freelance is unacceptably flat, with as much flavor as a mayonnaise glob between stale Wonder Bread slices.

Lentz and Morel are terrible when sustaining long-form storytelling, and Pettits, Venegas, and Wellington learn nothing because Freelance doesn’t teach lessons, it just reads the answers aloud.

Yu-rim stands her ground against the pushy director, giving Cobweb (not to be confused with the 2023 American horror film of the same title) some real substance early on before things go off the rails and writer-director Kim allows his film to drift towards self-indulgence in its collision of fictional worlds.'}\n",

All the preceding scenes of slapstick that concealed something more serious beneath the surface lose their power when technical razzle-dazzle overshadows everything else. Numerous obstacles may stand between an exasperated Ki-yeol and his efforts to finish a film that never measures up to the masterpiece in his mind, but as events inevitably escalate, Cobweb reveals itself to be nothing more than an exercise in style over substance.'}\n",

It’s a relationship that grows quickly tiresome, the quiet, mourning mother and the one-dimensional friend who exists only to provide the lead character with glaringly manufactured interactions to bring up her backstory.

All attempts to establish sympathy with the mother come from her position as, well, a mother, or hurried flashbacks employed as a crutch whenever the story hits one of its many dead ends.

Naturally, shots of Richard Nixon’s resignation make an appearance. To belabor this seamy (silly) mood, footage of various killers such as David Berkowitz, Charles Manson, and Ted Bundy are spliced in. Peppered throughout this sequence, as though what we’ve just seen isn’t heavy-handed enough, are images of social upheaval and, more pertinently, Satanism, the era’s favorite source of irrational panic and, clearly, the film’s big hook.
